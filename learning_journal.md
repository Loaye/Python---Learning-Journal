#Python Reading Journal

##Day 1 - 17 OCT 17
--------------------
Reviewing recursion, loops, imports TDD on my own time because I was out of town this day was good for me. I know how it's down in Javsacript and to see that the ideas are the same but the implentation in Python with Python's syntax was very helpful.

Importing is the most tricky concept today. JS you would just require the component out of the module or the everything. It will take me a little bit to get use to Python's syntax for it.
